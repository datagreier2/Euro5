Kultur,Non-scandi,The Guardian (UK),https://www.theguardian.com/uk,rss,The Disappearance of Jay Slater review – his parents deserve better than this,"The teenager’s family are grieving while having to contend with wild conspiracy theories and trolling. Surely this documentary should have done more to tackle such horrendous online abuse There is always a line in any documentary about a death, and especially that of a child, that suddenly distils the bereaved’s pain so effectively you can only bow before it and wonder at the strength of the human spirit surviving amid such suffering. In The Disappearance of Jay Slater, it comes from Jay’s father, Warren, as he remembers the brutal hope the family had that their son had been taken by kidnappers, and the online rumours swirling about his torture for a supposed drug debt. “At least if we’d got him back,” says Warren, “I could have mended him.” Nineteen-year-old Jay Slater went missing on 17 June last year. He was partying until the early hours with his pals at a music festival in Tenerife – the first time he had gone on holiday without his parents – then left a nightclub with two people he had met there and went back to their Airbnb 30 miles from his own digs. After a few hours’ sleep, he started to make his way back. Then he disappeared. His friends couldn’t get hold of him. His family flew from their home in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire to Tenerife and watched and waited as the search of the mountainous terrain he was thought to have tried to pass through was started by the Guardia Civil. This was expanded via volunteers and eventually concluded on 15 July when human remains were discovered at the bottom of a ravine, close to the last known location of Jay’s phone. DNA fingerprinting confirmed that this was Jay. A preliminary autopsy by the Spanish authorities said he had died as a result of head injuries sustained in a fall from a great height. Back in England, once the body had been repatriated, another autopsy agreed, and noted that toxicology results suggested he had ingested drugs and alcohol not very long before. The Disappearance of Jay Slater is on Channel 4 now.

After the turbulence and uncertainty of recent years, English National Opera opened its first season split between the London Coliseum and its new home in Manchester with an energetic display of institutional confidence. Not to mention a clear commitment to all things fun. Like other variants, Rossini’s take on the Cinderella story – usually known as La Cenerentola– is a rags-to-riches tale featuring a downtrodden heroine, her dreadful stepsisters and their equally awful father Don Magnifico. Plus a prince, his valet and a fairy godmother character that Rossini and his librettist transformed into a male philosopher, Alidoro. Julia Burbach’s colourful, contemporary-ish staging plays wittily with the story’s familiarity. A small team of uniformed mice equipped with clipboards, iPads and walkie talkies help Alidoro to keep the plot on track. Various shoes are handed around (although the operatic prince’s chosen form of bridal ID is a bracelet). And, instead of a pumpkin carriage, the stage is dominated throughout by a large metal-doored lift, which delivers the transformed Cinders to the party at the crucial moment.

But as the Beatles and Led Zep showed in the past, more scenic routes can pay off As the mania around them was erupting in early 1963, the Beatles toured the UK supporting Helen Shapiro, including shows in Wakefield, Taunton and Hanley (now amalgamated as part of Stoke-on-Trent). In late 1971, as their untitled fourth album was released, Led Zeppelin roared around the country, including stops in Preston, Bournemouth and Salisbury. Gathering a head of steam in 1994, Oasis performed in Tunbridge Wells, Derby and Newport. Promoting his debut album in 2011, Ed Sheeran stopped off in Keele, Falmouth and Aberdeen. But over the decades, most of these regional cities and towns steadily fell off the touring map as focus turned to the bigger cities, often those with large student populations.

As a TUC manifesto argues, those affected must have a greater say in shaping the workplace of the future In The Making of the English Working Class, the leftwing historian EP Thompson made a point of challenging the condescension of history towards luddism, the original anti-tech movement. The early 19th-century croppers and weavers who rebelled against new technologies should not be written off as “blindly resisting machinery”, wrote Thompson in his classic history. They were opposing a laissez-faire logic that dismissed its disastrous impact on their lives. A distinction worth bearing in mind as Britain rolls out the red carpet for US big tech, thereby outsourcing a modern industrial revolution still in its infancy. Photographers, coders and writers, for example, would sympathise with the powerlessness felt by working people who saw customary protections swept away in a search for enhanced productivity and profit.

USA,Non-scandi,The Guardian (UK),https://www.theguardian.com/uk,rss,"Ukraine war briefing: Zelenskyy urges west to cut off Russia’s energy revenues, saying decisive action ‘long overdue’","President’s plea comes after Russia bombards Kyiv and elsewhere in one of its most sustained attacks of the war. What we know on day 1,314 See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage Volodymyr Zelenskyy has again urged the international community to act decisively to cut off Russia’s energy revenues that fund its Ukraine war after Moscow carried out one of its worst attacks on Kyiv of the war. “The time for decisive action is long overdue, and we count on a strong response from the United States, Europe, the G7 and the G20,” the Ukrainian president said on Telegram. While the United Nations was holding general assembly sessions, Russia had “literally used every day, every hour, to strike at Ukraine”, he said in his nightly video address. Ukraine has so far failed to convince US president Donald Trump to impose punitive sanctions on Moscow. The onslaught on Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine killed at least four people in what Zelenskyy called a described as a “vile and cowardly” attack, Luke Harding reports. Russia launched nearly 600 drones and more than 40 cruise missiles in a bombardment that lasted more than 12 hours over Saturday night and into Sunday morning. The main targets were the Ukrainian capital and the regions of Zaporizhzhia, Khmelnytskyi, Sumy, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv and Odesa. The Ukrainian president noted the bombardments came at the close of UN general assembly week in New York, during which Donald Trump expressed support for Kyiv. A missile wiped out most of a street in Kyiv’s Petropavlivska Borshchahivka district, while a falling concrete slab killed a 12-year-old girl. Two of the other deaths occurred at a cardiology clinic in the capital. Across Ukraine 67 people were reported wounded, according to local authorities. Zelenskyy described the attack on the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia as “extraordinarily fierce”, with nearly 40 injured, while footage on social media showed several buildings badly damaged and on fire. Zelenskyy promised his country would “strike back”. “This is precisely how Russia shows its true position. Moscow wants to keep fighting and killing and deserves only the harshest pressure in the world,” he said on Telegram. “The Kremlin benefits from continuing this war and terror as long as energy revenues flow and the shadow fleet operates.” The US is considering Ukraine’s request to obtain long-range Tomahawk missiles for its war effort, vice-president JD Vance said. Zelenskyy has asked the US to sell Tomahawks to European nations that would send them to Ukraine. Vance told Fox News on Sunday that Donald Trump would make the “final determination” on whether to allow the deal. Trump has denied Ukraine’s requests for use of long-range missiles in the past – Tomahawks have a range of 2,500km (1,550 miles) – but is frustrated at Moscow’s refusal to reach a peace deal. Vance also said Russia’s invasion had stalled, with little in the way of territorial gains in Ukraine recently. “The Russians have got to wake up and accept reality here. A lot of people are dying. They don’t have a lot to show for it.” Continue reading...",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/29/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskyy-urges-west-to-cut-off-russias-energy-revenues-saying-decisive-action-long-overdue,2025-09-29T00:28:00+00:00,INT,False,True,3.908136878453031,3.908136878453031,,
USA,Non-scandi,The Guardian (UK),https://www.theguardian.com/uk,rss,Anemone review – Daniel Day-Lewis returns for a bleak and painfully serious misfire,"New York film festival: the actor un-retires, with his son onboard to direct, for a portentous and plodding film about war-torn men It has been eight long years since Daniel Day-Lewis last graced the screen, after the filming of 2017’s Phantom Thread left him “overwhelmed by a sense of sadness”. Retirement, it turns out, was more “ retirement ”, an extended bit of rest and recuperation for another gauntlet. Anemone, the three-time Oscar winner’s quote-unquote comeback film and the feature directorial debut of his son Ronan Day-Lewis, is an even less sunny experience. (At least for the viewer; Day-Lewis has described filming with his son as “beginning to end, just pure joy to spend that time together with him”.) In fact, it’s gray-skies-only for the film’s plodding two hours, the better to hammer home the point of roiling disquiet within, to quote the logline, “the complex and profound ties that exist between brothers, fathers, and sons”. Father and son, who co-wrote the script set in the late 1980s, seem aligned on the somber task of peeling back what has not been said for two generations of stoic, war-torn men. Anemone – a title that, like the film, is vaguely symbolic and overly portentous – settles in like fog on the northern English coast: at once heavy and weightless, overcast with dour import. It starts with a prayer (from Sean Bean, face creased with unrelenting seriousness) and proceeds into the mist of unexpressed trauma, over-communicated in close-up shots of bloody knuckles, blank walls and truncated torsos.
