Dads sneak their teenage daughters to the front of the heaving queue for the women’s toilets, which a girl with large hoop earrings has taken it upon herself to run like the navy (“Go! No time for wiping!”). A man desperately tries to keep up with his drunk-on-a-mission missus by hanging on to her belt loops, while a group of lads with photorealistic tattoos argue over whether to load up on pints or head in to secure a premium standing position. In every direction, best friends of all generations doggedly traverse a packed-out Wembley Stadium, each clutching two pints and a Twix to their chest. Others lean in for group selfies beneath the gigantic digital sign proclaiming “Oasis Live ’25”. The air is a tangle of Glaswegian accents, Rochdale accents, Cardiff accents, East End accents and Scouse accents as strangers genially befriend each other; the horizon a jumble of jeans-and-shoes, jorts, and bucket hats of all designs. There are people in original 1994 Definitely Maybe tour shirts, and people who weren’t even born when Creation Records dissolved; Gen X ravers who now manage sales teams, and millennials repping the H&M Pacha collection.

Bacchae reveals the virtues and vices of creating a new play from old How on earth do we stage Greek tragedy today? Broadly speaking, there are three possible approaches: re-creation, updating and rewriting. All three have been tried at the National Theatre across 30 productions, starting with Philoctetes in 1964 and leading to Nima Taleghani’s new Bacchae. Having seen virtually all of these, and visited the excellent exhibition about them in the Olivier’s Wolfson Gallery, I should be able to decide which is the best method. Yet, in all honesty, I find the National’s approach to the Greeks a strange mixture of hit and myth. Re-creating the past is, of course, impossible: as Edgar Allan Poe once remarked, reproducing an Attic tragedy for a modern audience is “the idea of a pedant and nothing beyond”. But, even if we are not living in Athens in the fifth century BC, we can adopt the staging techniques then used. The most zealous attempt to do so came from Peter Hall who, in his 1981 production of Aeschylus’s The Oresteia, had an all-male cast entirely in masks. Masks were employed in ancient Athens because the occasion was a religious ritual. One actor played many roles and facial features had to be exaggerated in a vast space; what was once a practical necessity now seemed an artistic barrier. But that doesn’t invalidate the attempt to imaginatively recreate the past.

But I hadn’t expected this to be such an emotional wrench Not counting the many thousands of words I spent complaining about being pregnant, I wrote my first column about my son, T, 18 years ago today, when he was three hours old. Someone said, “Is there some kind of union you could join? Because I’m sure you’re entitled to at least one whole day of maternity leave,” and I was baffled. As far as I was concerned, they should have held the front page – this wasn’t work, this was a dispatch from the frontline of a brave new world. Anyway, some time passed, and T could suddenly talk, and then some further time passed, and he was his own person, out there in the world, and then I blinked, and he was as tall as a tree. People always say to you, “Treasure this time, it goes by in a flash,” right at the moment you have an armful of toddler, puree in your hair and a mouth full of wet wipes because you ran out of hands – which in retrospect was fortunate, because it meant you couldn’t say the thing you would otherwise have said.

As a TUC manifesto argues, those affected must have a greater say in shaping the workplace of the future In The Making of the English Working Class, the leftwing historian EP Thompson made a point of challenging the condescension of history towards luddism, the original anti-tech movement. The early 19th-century croppers and weavers who rebelled against new technologies should not be written off as “blindly resisting machinery”, wrote Thompson in his classic history. They were opposing a laissez-faire logic that dismissed its disastrous impact on their lives. A distinction worth bearing in mind as Britain rolls out the red carpet for US big tech, thereby outsourcing a modern industrial revolution still in its infancy. Photographers, coders and writers, for example, would sympathise with the powerlessness felt by working people who saw customary protections swept away in a search for enhanced productivity and profit. Unlicensed use of their creative labour to train generative AI has delivered vast revenues to Silicon Valley while rendering their livelihoods increasingly precarious.

Back in the 1980s, when writers’ spats and affairs made headlines, the winning ceremony was televised by the BBC. It was the book world’s Oscars. Today, the idea of tuning in to watch the dinner-suited literati tuck into supper in London’s oak-panelled Guildhall seems preposterous. But the UK’s most prestigious literary prize still needs to reach as wide an audience as possible. How do you sell “posh bingo”, as Julian Barnes memorably dubbed it, to the BookTok generation? It is no longer enough to tell people what they should be reading. Readers expect to be part of the conversation – to be in the bingo hall. This year’s shortlist was announced live by the chair and former Booker prizewinner Roddy Doyle at an event at London’s Southbank Centre, with behind-the-scenes chat from the panel. The event was also livestreamed. Explore the shortlist for this year’s Booker prize and, for a limited time, get all six books for only £75 at guardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply.

Now, in a spectacular production, its first performers are bringing it back. But would Bausch have approved? Theatres are haunted houses: on any stage, the ghosts of past performances can rise. At the opera house in Wuppertal, North Rhine-Westphalia, you can imagine the decades-ago premieres of Pina Bausch’s first potent tanztheater shows, which left audiences either enraptured or slamming the exit door. An original cast member may still appear in revivals today, giving a tantalising link to the history of a company now packed with dancers who joined after the German choreographer’s death in 2009. But tonight a full house in Wuppertal is watching Bausch’s classic Kontakthof delivered by a cast of nine, all of whom created it here almost 50 years ago. And they are accompanied by ethereal archive footage of the production from 1978, blown up to a dizzying scale. It is uncanny and moving to see them enter, in monochrome outfits, their steps mirroring those from the black and white film projected on an enormous gauze screen. It engulfs the performers so the images of their younger selves, at a height of several metres, loom over them. Kontakthof was first staged with 20 dancers and those who have not returned for this iteration – some of them deceased – remain frozen in time in film, accompanying tonight’s cast who have more than doubled in age since.

Our unwritten constitution rests on the hard-won principle that we are citizens, not subjects of the government. Free people who are not required to carry papers at the demand of authority – an authority that is our servant, not our master. At present, the state may ask us for identification, but it cannot compel us. That distinction is not a quibble of law but a line in the sand – it defines the relationship between people and power. Britain has long stood apart from continental traditions of state surveillance. The freedom to go about one’s business without having to show papers has always been more than a convenience; it is a quiet assertion of dignity, liberty and trust in the people.
